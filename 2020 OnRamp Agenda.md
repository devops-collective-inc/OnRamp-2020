Your schedule includes attending keynotes and major events in the main conference.
You are also invited and encouraged to attend all evening social events.
These events are what makes this conference special.

## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all OnRamp sessions.
You are __not__ permitted to jump back and forth between OnRamp and main conference sessions.
We have a lot of material to cover and we will be starting sessions on time.

## Course Material

We will be using the OnRamp Slack channel for communications.
If you have questions or comments that you don't feel comfortable asking during the day, please use this channel.
This is also a great way to network with other attendees.
Presentation material, including slides and sample code will be available on Github at [https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2020](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2020).
